# Integrating Flink with external system

External system can act as a source or a sink.

These can be API's, Database (mongodb, hbase), message broker (kafka, rabbitMq).

To integrate with third party system basically we need to add the dependency in the Flink application - known as **connector**.

*For example*:

I. **To connect Flink with Twitter**

*This is an example of integrating Flink with API*.

- we add dependencies of Twitter in pom.xml

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-connector-twitter_2.11</artifactId>
  <version>1.5.1</version>
</dependency>
```

- enter Twitter related configurations.
- then we use *addSource()* class for adding any source.
- then transform the data as required.

II. **to connect Flink with Kafka**

*This is an example of integrating Flink with message broker*.

- It designs a messaging platform for distributed systems.kafka is based on producer-consumer terminology.
- we add dependencies for kafka in pom.xml

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-connector-kafka-0.11_2.11</artifactId> # this version depends on which kafka we are using
  <version>1.5.1</version>
</dependency>
```

- enter kafka related configurations.
- then we use *addSource()* class for adding any source.
- then transform the data as required.
